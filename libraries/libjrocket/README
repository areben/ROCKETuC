==========================================================================

This is library provides a Java binding to a MCU running the ROCKETuC firmware.

The README describes, how to compile the library by using ant.    



Project Directory Layout
------------------------

The top-level directory structure of the libjrocket project looks something like this:

+- build.xml       Ant build file
+- dist            Library JAR file will be placed here
+- README          This README
+- src             The Java sources


Prerequisites
-------------

To compile all the libraries, a JDK (>= 5), Ant and RXTXcomm.jar (http://rxtx.qbang.org/)
are needed. Check the "build.xml" to refelct the path where your RXTXcomm.jar is located.
On Ubuntu there is a package "librxtx-java" which you could apt-get. 


Compilation
------------

** Using ant on the commandline

To compile the sources go to the libraries top-level directory and issue:

ant

This will produce the binaries (classes) under "bin". To create a distributable
JAR file, issue:

ant dist

This will place the library under "dist". To clean up the binaries under "bin", 
and the library under "dist" usr:

ant clean


** Using eclipse

You clould also use eclipse to compile the project. Just click on "New Project" and
choose "Creste Project from Existing Ant file" and follow the wizzard.


Examples
--------

Some examples are located under "src/rocketuc/jrocket/examples". On the commandline,
you could run them after a successful build from the top-level library directory
 like this:

java -cp ./bin:/usr/share/java/RXTXcomm.jar rocketuc.jrocket.examples.<ExampleClassToRun>

Or, if you produced the library with "ant dist", you could use:

java -cp ./dist/lib/libjrocket.jar:/usr/share/java/RXTXcomm.jar rocketuc.jrocket.examples.<ExampleClassToRun>
