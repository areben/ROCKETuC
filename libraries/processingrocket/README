==========================================================================

This is library provides a processing library for connecting to a MCU running 
the ROCKETuC firmware. This is basically a processing wrapper around "libjrocket". 

The README describes, how to compile the library by using ant.    

NOTE: The library supports Processing 2.0 only!


Project Directory Layout
------------------------

The top-level directory structure of the processingrocket project looks something like this:

+- data          Extra data that goes into the processing library
+- distribution  The distributable processing library goes here
+- examples      PDE examples that go into the processing library
+- extlib        Third-Party libraries needed at compiltime
+- lib           Third-Party libraries that go into processing library
+- sketchbook    If no other directory was configured, sketchbook for library testing in 
                 processing
+- README        This README
+- resources     Resources needed for building, includes "build.xml" and "build.properties" 
+- src           Java sources for the processing library
+- web           HTML page with summary for this library


Prerequisites
-------------

To compile all the libraries, a JDK (>= 5), and Ant are needed. 

Since this library relays on "libjrocket", this library needs to be in place as 
well. By default, it is included as a symlink under the "lib" subdirectory. If, 
for some reason, this does not work for your (e.g. because your OS does not support 
symlinks), then just hardcopy the library from "i../libjrocket/dist/lib" to "lib". 

For instructions on how to compile "libjerocket" see the README in that projects
sub-directory. 

Also check "build.properties" under "ressources" to reflect your path for the sketchbook location.
By default a sketchbook is created in the projects top-level directory.


Compilation
------------

** Using ant on the commandline

To compile the sources go to the "ressources" directory of the library and issue:

ant

This will produce the distributable processing library as a ZIP-file under 
distribution. It will also put the library into your "sketchbook" location 
so you could check the library with processing imidiately. 


** Using eclipse

You clould also use eclipse to compile the project. Just click on "New Project" and
choose "Creste Project from Existing Ant file" and follow the wizzard.


Examples
--------

After compiling the library and (re-)starting processing, go to "File/Example", choose "Contributed Libraries" and open "processingrocket" to see the available PDE examples.
