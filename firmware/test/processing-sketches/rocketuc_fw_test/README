==========================================================================

This PDE incldues testcases to use against the "serial-rocket" firmware. It performs some basic tests against the firmware, checks the results and prints them out.


Prerequisites
-------------

Make sure "serial-rocket" is compiled and flashed to your device. Open the PDE in your processing IDE, double check the serial port used in the source.  

Also make sure "librocketcore", "libserial" and "libconio" libraries are already successfully compiled. To perform all of the tests, the following needs to be wired up on the Launchpad:

* add additional LED to P2.5
* add additional button btw. P2.3 and VDD
* add additional button btw. P2.4 and GND 
* add additional 10k poti between P1.5 and Vcc
* add signal line (PWM) of servo to P2.2

For complete schematic see "msp430g2553_launchpad_testsetup.png" under "doc/schematic" in the top-level directory.


Basic Usage
----------------------------

For the TI Launchpad, connect the USB-port to your PC. Run the PDE, watch the results.
