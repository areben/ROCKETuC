==========================================================================

"libconio" provides a simple to use API for writing text to a console. Currently the console is the UART on USCI_A on the MSP430.  The library is not HW dependend since the HW part is provided by "libserial". Thus, this library is dependend on "libserial". The library is mainly used in the test firmware to provide some feedback on a serial console. 

This README describes, how to compile the library under Linux.
