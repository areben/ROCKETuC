Console IO C-library for MSP430G2553 MCUs
==========================================


"libconio" provides a simple to use API for writing text to a console. Currently the console is theUART on USCI_A on the MSP430.  The library is not HW dependend since the HW part is provided by "libserial". Thus, this library is dependend on "libserial".
