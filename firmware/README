Compilation
------------

The firmware depends on "libemb".  The compilation steps described here assume, that you installed "libemb" for your target platform.  

For MSP430, it is assumed you have installed a working msp430-gcc along with ths mspdebug tool (newer Ubuntu distributions provide packages for both).

To compile the firmware, change to the toplevel directory "firmware" and issue:

make

This will produce the firmware binary in various formats in the "bin" subdirectory as well es test firmwarfe binaries under "test/*"

Flashing
------------

make flash-target

For the MSP430 target on a Launchpad, the "mspdebug" tool is used for flashing. 

Doxygen Docs
------------

If you installed doxygen on your system, you could generate the HTML-based API documentation by calling:

make gen-docs

This will create the API documentation under "doc/gen/html".
