This is the ROCKETuC Project

Project Structure
-----------------

The ROCKETuC project mainly consits of two parts: 

- the ROCKETuC firmware
- the ROCKETuC libraries


ROCKETuC Firmware
-----------------

The fimrware exposes the functionality of an MCU (e.g. like digitial IO, analog
readings or pulse-width-modulation) through a protocol to a client. As physical
transport, for the protocol, currently the serial line only is supported. 

For more information on the firmware see the README of the corresponding 
sub-project:

* TODO: add link to readme 


** Supported Hardware

Currently the only supported hardware is the TI Launchpad equipped with an
MSP430G2553 MCU. 

For more information on the firmware implementation on specific hardware
platforms see this README:

* TODO: link to core-protocol-implementation


ROCKETuC Libraries
------------------

A MCU loaded with the above mentioned fimrware could be used 
through different client libraries, targeting different programming
languages. Currently the following libraries are part of the ROCKETuC
project:

- libjrocket for Java
- processingrocket for Processing


** libjrocket

This library provides a ROCKETuC binding for Java. For more details on 
this library see the sub-projects README:

* TODO: link to readme


** processingrocket

processingrocket provides a library for the Processing environment. It 
uses libjrocket as core. For more details on this library see the 
sub-projects README:
