This is the ROCKETuC Project
----------------------------

A Library for fast prototyping of micro-controllers through serial protocols. 
Currently the TI Launchpad with an MSP430G2553 installed is the only supported 
hardware.

homepage: http://rocketuc.com


Project Structure
-----------------

The ROCKETuC project mainly consists of two parts: 

- the ROCKETuC firmware
- the ROCKETuC libraries


ROCKETuC Firmware
-----------------

The firmware exposes the functionality of an MCU (e.g. like digital IO, analog
readings or pulse-width-modulation) through a protocol to a client. As physical
transport, for the protocol, currently the serial line only is supported. 

For more information on the firmware see the README of the corresponding 
sub-project:

* https://github.com/areben/ROCKETuC/blob/master/firmware/README 

A more detailed description of the firmware architecture coudl be found
here:

* https://github.com/areben/ROCKETuC/blob/master/firmware/doc/Architecutre.txt


** Supported Hardware

Currently the only supported hardware is the TI Launchpad equipped with an
MSP430G2553 MCU. 

For more information on the firmware implementation on specific hardware
platforms see this README:

* https://github.com/areben/ROCKETuC/blob/master/firmware/doc/CoreProtocolImplementation.txt 


ROCKETuC Libraries
------------------

A MCU loaded with the above mentioned firmware could be used 
through different client libraries, targeting different programming
languages. Currently the following libraries are part of the ROCKETuC
project:

- libjrocket for Java
- processingrocket for Processing


** libjrocket

This library provides a ROCKETuC binding for Java. For more details on 
this library see the sub-projects README:

* https://github.com/areben/ROCKETuC/blob/master/libraries/libjrocket/README 


** processingrocket

processingrocket provides a library for the Processing environment. It 
uses libjrocket as core. For more details on this library see the 
sub-projects README:

* https://github.com/areben/ROCKETuC/blob/master/libraries/processingrocket/README

A getting started guide with examples is available here:

* https://github.com/areben/ROCKETuC/blob/master/libraries/processingrocket/doc/ROCKETuC_getting_started_with_processing.txt


** processing

a stand-alone library for Processing (without eventing support) is also available. 
For more details on this library see the sub-project:

* https://github.com/areben/ROCKETuC/tree/master/libraries/processing 


Develop your own ROCKETuC Client-Library
----------------------------------------

You are welcome, and we would love to hear from yout what library you came up with. 
For a statring point, you may want to have a look at one of the existing implementations
and/or at the client implementation hints:
